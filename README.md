	>I want you guys to work on a few things over Christmas break:
	
	* If you don't feel like you know it enough yet, work a little more on pushing code to GitHub.
		* [Code School -Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
		* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
	
	* Start learning Java. I know it's a large task, but without it, robotics will be very difficult for you.
		* [LearnJava](http://www.learnjavaonline.org/)
		* [Java Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPvGqX-TXP0)
		* [Intro to Java Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs046) (This is a college course. It is much longer and difficult, but more rewarding if any of you are willing to try it)
	
	* If you want, poke around in our old robotics code, look at the FIRST API, and check out chief Delphi
		* [2014RobotCode](https://github.com/owatonnarobotics/2014RobotCode)
		* [FRC Java API](http://robotics.francisparker.org/javadoc/) *(I think that's the right one...)*
		* [Chief Delphi - Programming](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=51)
	
	
	Have a great Christmas! See you all Monday, and again when robotics starts!
Good Luck, and always feel free to contact anyone on our team!
